### Project Title
# Investigate a Relational Database

### Description
This project uses PostgreSQL to query the [Sakila DVD Rental database](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/).  The Sakila DVD Rental database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs.
The queries will gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.

### Queries

**1. Quartiles of the Rental-duration for Family-friendly Movies**
* Provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the rental duration for movies across all categories


**2. Two Stores Compare in Rental Orders**
* Find out how the two stores compare in their count of rental orders during every month for all the years we have data for

**3. Top 10 Paying Customers’ Monthly Payment**
* Write a query to capture the customer name, month and year of payment, and total payment amount for each month by these top 10 paying customers

**4. Top 10 paying Customers’ Monthly Payment Differences**
* For each of these top 10 paying customers, find out the difference across their monthly payments during 2007
